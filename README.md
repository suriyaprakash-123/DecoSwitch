DecoSwitch is an innovative home automation project designed to efficiently control multiple appliances using a minimal number of switches. The system consists of a microcontroller connected to a decoder, where the decoder’s inputs are controlled by physical switches, and its outputs manage various appliances. Since a decoder with n inputs can produce 2ⁿ outputs, this approach drastically reduces the number of switches required, optimizing space while maintaining full control over connected devices. By leveraging this architecture, DecoSwitch simplifies wiring, minimizes hardware complexity, and enhances scalability, making it an ideal solution for both residential and industrial automation. This system offers significant benefits, including space optimization, reduced installation complexity, and seamless scalability for controlling additional appliances. With its microcontroller-based design, it can be further enhanced by integrating IoT features such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity, voice control, or touchscreen interfaces. Potential applications include smart home automation, industrial control systems, and embedded systems projects, providing an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional switch-based control mechanisms. Future improvements may include remote access, automated scheduling, and smart analytics, further advancing the capabilities of DecoSwitch in modern automation solutions.
